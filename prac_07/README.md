# CP1404 Practicals

## About This Repository
This repository contains my practical work for the subject CP1404 – Programming II at James Cook University. It includes code and learning exercises focused on Python programming, clean coding techniques, and version control using Git and GitHub.

My name is Lachlan Torrisi, and I am studying Mathematics & Data Science. Throughout these practicals, I have been developing my problem solving.

Main Lessons Learned About Clean Code
Use meaningful names: Choosing clear and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes makes code easier to read and understand.
Follow the Single Responsibility Principle: Each function or class should have one job, improving clarity and maintainability.
Don’t repeat yourself (DRY): Avoid duplicating code by refactoring repeated logic into reusable functions or methods.
