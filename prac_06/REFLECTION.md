# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I now plan before coding, read all instructions carefully, and use constants, functions, and proper naming from the start.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I need to work on my commit messages, (naming and when to use them), work on time management, and when to fix certain errors.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I think my pep-8 style and use of docstrings have improved alot since programming 1.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

Stop writing everything in main function and making sure I divide it up nicely, and use other functions when needed.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

Adding more shorter practice (focusing on like 2 lines of code)
